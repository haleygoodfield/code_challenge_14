# My Fourteenth Coding Challenge
This is my fourteenth coding challenge using JavaScript. Here, I will apply my skills in DOM manipulation to dynamically add, update, and remove support tickets to create an interactive **Customer Support Ticket System** for managing support requests in a company. 
This scenario will be split into 5 Tasks: 
+ Task 1: Creating the Base Structure
+ Task 2: Adding Support Tickets Dynamically
+ Task 3: Converting NodeLists to Arrays for Bulk Updates
+ Task 4: Implementing Ticket Resolution with Event Bubbling
+ Task 5: Inline Editing of Support Tickets
